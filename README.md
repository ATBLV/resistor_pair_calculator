A utility application which will likely be useful to precisely no one.... Created to practice (originally python and) javascript and calibrate opamps for work more effectively and efficiently. 

Background

One particular job I had as a technician was to calibrate op-amps to a specified gain or output. This required a specific resistance value to be acquired with a pair of resistors in parallel to be used in circuit. With this app I could determine with the resistors on-hand, a pair resulting in a value which most closely matched that which was required. 

E12 series resistors provided a greater range of resultant values. It is also what I had available to me. A provision of additional resistor values being able to be added via an input field allowed even greater resolution of results.
